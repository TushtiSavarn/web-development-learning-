<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey there! I'm a passionate BCA student at Banasthali Vidyapeeth '25, where I've learned the art of merging traditional problem-solving methods with modern techniques. 
As Artificial Intelligence intern at Technook I am learning and applying skill sets in the field of Artificial intelligence  .

In the past as a Data Science Intern at Bharat Intern,I got to apply what I've learned to extract meaningful insights from data using python,and AI.

 My experience as an Ex-Campus Ambassador at Internshala has honed my soft skills including communication, leadership, and time management, which are crucial for fostering collaboration.

Here's a detailed look at my skills:

Data Science:
Proficient in data preprocessing techniques, including data cleaning, transformation, and normalization. Skilled in exploratory data analysis to uncover patterns, trends, and outliers.Experienced in applying statistical methods and hypothesis testing to derive actionable insights.Knowledgeable in machine learning algorithms such as regression, classification, clustering, and ensemble methods.
Competent in data visualization tools like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly for creating informative visualizations.Familiar with popular data science libraries and frameworks such as Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and TensorFlow.

AI/ML Enthusiast:

Experienced in natural language processing (NLP) techniques for text classification, sentiment analysis, and named entity recognition.Proficient in building and deploying machine learning models using frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch.Skilled in deep learning architectures such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and transformer models.Knowledgeable in reinforcement learning concepts and algorithms for building autonomous agents and decision-making systems.Familiar with model evaluation techniques like cross-validation, hyperparameter tuning, and model interpretation methods.

While I'm still learning Full Stack Development, I'm proficient in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I'm actively exploring frameworks like Bootstrap, React.js, and Vue.js. I'm also familiar with back-end technologies such as Django, Flask, MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, RESTful API design, and Git.

 Outside of academics, I find solace in dance.Let's connect and explore opportunities together!
I'm always on the lookout for like-minded individuals who share my passion for innovation and continuous learning. Let's connect and embark on this exciting journey together!</p>
